<p>Essential Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is humanization?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is radical humanization important?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we contextualize other people&#8217;s backgrounds?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Students choose any political conflict, in the present or in history, and reimagine the outcome of that situation if radical humanization was used.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ten Lessons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Introduction to Radical Humanization</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Students will be introduced to the concept of radical humanization and apply it to a specific conflict they have experienced in their own life. They will reimagine the situation using a lens of radical humanization and understand why it is useful in real life.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>School discipline</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Students will recreate a discipline policy handbook for their school that they feel would be more beneficial and impactful to the student through the lens of radical humanization</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Abortion</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span id="pg2" role="doc-pagebreak" title="2"></span>Students will read argumentative essays that are either for or against abortion. If a student is pro abortion they will read the essay that is against abortion. If a student is against abortion, they will read the essay that is for abortion</p>
<p>Students will then research the backgrounds of each author and try to understand why their positions are the way they are.</p>
<p>Students will then write their own argumentative pieces on abortion, and they will take the position opposite from their own personal opinion.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Incarceration</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask students to write about their current perspectives on felons and criminals.</p>
<p>Teach students about the racism and classism of the American justice system</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="none1">
<li><p>i. School to prison pipeline</p></li>
<li><p>ii. The war on drugs- history and its effect on Black Americans today</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Socratic seminar on the injustices of mass incarceration and how radical humanization could be a remedy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask the students how knowing the history of mass incarceration helps them contextualize the lives of many who are incarcerated</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Israel/Palestine conflict part 1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complete basic background to the conflict</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Israel/ Palestine conflict part 2 (socratic seminar)</p>

</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Reflections</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span id="pg3" role="doc-pagebreak" title="3"></span>Students share their thoughts on radical humanization</p>

</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>Rationale</p>
<p>Radical Humanization is contextualizing the lives of individuals, defying dehumanization, and empathizing with those who possess opinions and experiences that you cannot understand. It is a mindset and practice that requires patience and a deep level of understanding of others. From petty arguments to large scale political problems, it is a useful means of conflict resolution for a variety of situations. It is inherently antiracist, anti-sexist, anti-islamaphobia, anti-xenophobia, etc. as everyone is seen as equally human and held to the same standards. This is not to be confused with excusing the malicious actions of others, as radical humanization is just a means of contextualizing other&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>I would like to teach this concept in seventh-grade social studies class for two main reasons. Middle school tends to be the setting for petty school drama between students. Utilizing the mindset of radical humanization is useful to conflict resolution in these small scale conflicts. Seventh graders also begin to understand the world around them through a political sense and begin to form political values, where radical humanization is extremely useful to ensure that their political values are not built upon hate and misunderstandings of the other.</p>
<p><span id="pg4" role="doc-pagebreak" title="4"></span>Freire supports humanization within pedagogical styles, which he determines is a pathway to the liberation of students. His proposed form of humanization through pedagogy is problem-posed education which is an education where the teacher and students learn simultaneously, destructing traditional power dynamics of pedagogy. He coins the term &#8220;necrophilly&#8221; to explain an approach that is mechanic and is characterized by relationships of possession where there is a clear power dynamic between the possessed and possessor. He then states that &#8220;oppression- overwhelming control- is necrophilic&#8221; (Freire 77) and that authentic liberation is the &#8220;process of humanization&#8221; (Freire 79). He calls for problem-posing education partly in an effort to liberate the oppressed and integrate them into society. The first lesson in the unit exemplifies problem-posing education as both students and teachers will participate in sharing a past conflict they experienced and alter the outcome using a lens of radical humanization. This shows the student that radical humanization is applicable throughout all stages of life and useful for everyone. It also shows that one can always be critical of conflicts they engage in and the way they handle them, and conflict resolution is something that can always be worked on. This curriculum is entirely inspired by Freire&#8217;s values and beliefs of humanization being a pathway to liberation. Each lesson is focused on treating others as equals and understanding them as entire human beings, and not just judging them based on their beliefs. By teaching students how to humanize others, students gain the tools to exercise the liberating process of humanization in their own life, therefore becoming agents of liberation themselves.</p>
<p>In &#8220;We Want to do More Than Survive&#8221;, Bettina Love discusses the importance of abolitionist teaching that is done with complete love and acceptance of those who are oppressed. She advocates for teaching children about injustice, oppression and power dynamics to expose <span id="pg5" role="doc-pagebreak" title="5"></span>them to the imperfectness of the world as opposed to shielding the students from these harsh realities as the first step towards liberation. Love&#8217;s values are seen in this curriculum in lessons based on the Israel-Palestine conflict and mass incarceration in America. In these two lessons, students will learn about the oppression of Palestinians, Black Americans and the Jewish throughout history forcing them to become aware of major power imbalances and injustices. Love then states that abolitionist teaching is begun by freedom dreaming which is reenvisioning a realistic society that is more equal and just and &#8220;grounded in a critique of injustice (Love 101). This curriculum is inspired by this concept and integrates this important pillar of abolitionist teaching into the curriculum by transforming it into a pillar for radical humanization for students to learn as well. Students are taught how to freedom dream in many lessons, but most importantly in the lesson based on school discipline. Students will analyze the school&#8217;s discipline handbook and identify it&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses. Then, using a lens of radical humanization, they create new disciplinary policies that they feel would foster a more humanizing learning environment. Students are explicitly creating an idea of a more just world, which is the first step of abolitionism according to Love.</p>
<p>This curriculum was completely inspired by Love and Freire&#8217;s teachings as it focuses on humanization as a means of liberation. Using their teachings, I created exercises and lessons to teach the concept of radical humanization to the students which are based on both interacting with the &#8220;other&#8221; and learning how to solve different conflicts on different scales. Fostering a lens of humanization within the students during school time will most likely cause them to become agents of liberation outside of the school setting, which is the ultimate goal of this unit.</p>
<p><span id="pg6" role="doc-pagebreak" title="6"></span>Lesson Plan</p>
<p>Lesson 1: Introduction to Radical Humanization</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Objectives:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Students will be familiar with the concept of radical humanization.</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Students will be able to critique their own life experiences through a lens of radical humanization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Procedures:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Ask students and teachers to think of a time they were involved in a simple disagreement with someone else and write it down.</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Ask them to contextualize the perspective of the other person/people using the following questions and write down the answers as well.</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; What are the backgrounds of the two parties of the conflict?</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Why did each person act the way they did?</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; What are each person&#8217;s intentions?</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Why are these their intentions?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Introduce radical humanization (the definition)</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Work in groups of 5 to choose one of the group members experiences and use it as inspiration for a skit. The students will reimagine the conflict in a way that ends in a solution inspired by radical humanization. Class will end in a performance of all of the skits. After each group performs the students will identify what part(s) conveyed radical humanization.</p></li>
</ul></li></ul>
<p>Lesson 2: School discipline</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Ask students to write about a time when they were disciplined.</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; What did they do?</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Why did they do it?</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; What was the punishment?</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Did they feel like the punishment matched the severity of the crime?</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Did they feel like the punishment was productive in ensuring that they wouldn&#8217;t repeat the action that got them in the first place?</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; If the answer to questions 4 and 5 is no, what would&#8217;ve been a sufficient and more productive punishment?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Take the school handbook and read different excerpts that focus on harsh punishments (ie suspension and expulsion). Discuss using the same prompts for the opening writing exercise.</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan"><span id="pg7" role="doc-pagebreak" title="7"></span>&#8211; Reimagine a more productive discipline system within the school and imagine the effects it would have on the community as a whole in groups of 4 or 5.</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Students will each share out their ideal discipline policies with the class. The class will choose which they like best depending on which is more aligned with the concept of radical humanization</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Students will then propose their chosen discipline policies to the school principal as a united class. They will each write argumentative essays using these questions to guide them:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Which policies do you wish to change?</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; What is wrong with these policies? Be specific.</p></li>
<li><p class="hyphan">&#8211; Why would it be beneficial to the students to change these policies?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
